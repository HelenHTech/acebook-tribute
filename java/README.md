# Project: Acebook

For this project you will be working in teams to produce a social media platform.

Each team will start with a codebase and a virtual card-wall with some initial tickets to get you started.

**Important:** the learning curve will be steeper than the Rails pathway because part of your work over the next two weeks will be not only to learn the Spring MVC framework, but also to learn the basics of Java and React, whereas in the Rails pathway you mostly only concentrate on the Rails MVC web framework.
