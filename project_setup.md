1. Think. Discuss. Choose!

## 1. Project Seed

1. Nominate a team member to own the fork, and then fork the template repository (Check the pathway for details)
2. In the forked repo settings, add team members and project coaches as collaborators
3. In the forked repo settings, rename the repo with your team name `acebook-<Team Name>`
4. Each member can then clone the fork to their local machine and follow the set up instructions in the repo's `README.md`

## 2. Documenting your learning

- Choose one of the following:

#### A blog
- Create a team account at `medium.com`
- Rotate team members to create posts: keep a record of what you learn and get blocked on

#### A wiki
- Document your stand-ups, retrospectives, knowledge-share sessions. The github project wiki could be a good place to start

#### Another tool
- If you like using another tool, use it!

## 3. Card Wall

- Choose one of the following:

#### GitHub issue + waffle.io
- Register for waffle.io with GitHub
- Set up a waffle for the repository, and watch the magic happen!

## 4. Planning Session

**MUST:**
- Read through [how to run a 2-day sprint](../how-to/2_day_sprint.md)
- Plan your first sprint

To help, have a read through these pills. Writing smaller and better tickets will really help speed your development, as will estimating the complexity of the work to be done. You can make better decisions about your work:
