# C# / .NET - Learning Objectives

Many of these have already been written up as tickets in the [corresponding trello template](https://trello.com/b/Dgcyzjcp/acebook-csharp-template)

### Set up

1. Get the [Mac C# SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
2. Get [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Open VSCode and install the following extensions
  * C#
  * C# Extensions
  * C# XML Documentation Comments
  * Code Runner

### High Level

* Diagram a high-level view of the MVC architecture
  * Compare and contrast to another MVC framework
* Clone the [demo app](https://github.com/laxmansahni/TodoApi/)
* Get the application up and running
  * [This](https://medium.com/@agavatar/webapi-with-net-core-and-postgres-in-visual-studio-code-8b3587d12823) might help
* Diagram the sequence of events when you launch the application
  * HINT: Your _debugging tools_ will come in handy here
* Diagram a request and response cycle of a user interacting with the app

### Specific goals

**Important:** Feel free to add, update this as much as you feel is helpful. Use your team, pair partners, or a coach to break each step into smaller steps if it's helpful.
